Assalamulaikum!<br>
This is Rana Bepari. I have just completed my B.Sc. in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE). I recently developed my skills in programming languages like PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java and so on. I worked before as a WordPress developer and fixed Laravel issues on Fiverr. I started to develop the Laravel website on the other side. Now I have developed my skills and am continuously learning and trying to improve them. I developed some Laravel websites with multi-auth panels and added some advanced features. You can see this from the "Samples" menu. I also developed some apps in Android Studio as practice. <br>
<br>
Thanks, <br>
